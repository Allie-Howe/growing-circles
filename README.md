# p5-boilerplate
Boilerplate code for a node-based p5.js sketch using Typescript and Parcel

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm` after installing Node.js)

## To start:
1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `pnpm i` to install p5 and Parcel
3. Run `pnpm start` to run Parcel, which should open the app in your browser automatically
4. You're done! Change the code and it'll update the browser right away

### Note:
You can also use `pnpm run build` to create a static site
